This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: a subquery in the WHERE clause returning multiple rows.  The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous code, while `solution.sql` provides a corrected version using a JOIN.  The problem arises when trying to compare a single column with multiple results from a subquery, leading to an error.  The solution uses JOINs for more efficient and correct result retrieval.
