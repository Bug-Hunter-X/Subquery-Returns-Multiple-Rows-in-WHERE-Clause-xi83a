The solution replaces the subquery in the WHERE clause with a JOIN. This approach is more efficient and avoids the error caused by comparing a single value with multiple results. For example, if the original query was:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');
```

And the `departments` table had multiple entries with `location = 'New York'`, it would fail.  The corrected version would be:

```sql
SELECT employees.*
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id
WHERE departments.location = 'New York';
```
This revised query uses an INNER JOIN to retrieve only the employees from departments located in New York, correctly handling multiple departments in that location.
